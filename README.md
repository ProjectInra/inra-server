**Inra Server** is a set of JavaScript libraries for creating back-end solutions on a higher level of abstraction. This project is very experimental, as it brings to life patterns very rarely seen in Node.js such as _inversion of control_, _dependency injectors_, _autoloaders_.

>**Note:** documentation and examples for each package are published on our [Wiki](https://github.com/project-inra/inra-server/wiki) and their respectives [READMEs](#list-of-packages). Please, refer to those resources for installation details and API references.

## Installation

**Inra Server** is written using _ES2015 modules_. Create a custom bundle using your preferred bundler. To import Inra into your application, just import Inra modules that you need.

>**Note:** some packages such as [`inra-server-http`](/packages/inra-server-container) are incompatible with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), as Webpack doesn't support dynamic imports.
